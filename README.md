# landing-page
This is my second web dev project.

I will be only using html and css here for now, and try to make a good-looking website from scratch. I will be using flexbox for css mainly here as this is pretty much more practice for flexbox.

Note: that everything written here are baloney and stuff so this just for display and show offing and stuff like that. For now. In the future I will use this website for actual presentations and real authentic works but not now.
